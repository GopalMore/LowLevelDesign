/*10. What happens if a class implements an interface with a default method
        and also inherits the same method from a superclass? Which one gets priority?
âœ¨Answer:The method from the superclass takes priority over the default method in the interface.
 The class will inherit the superclasses method unless it explicitly overrides it.
ðŸ§  Explanation:
In Java, when a class:
Extends a superclass, and
Implements an interface that defines a default method with the same signature â€”
ðŸ‘‰ The superclass method always takes precedence over the interfaceâ€™s default method.
Thatâ€™s because:
Class > Interface in Javaâ€™s method resolution order.
The compiler gives priority to inheritance from classes to preserve consistent class hierarchy behavior.
