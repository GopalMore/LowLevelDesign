# üéØ **Top Java Interview Questions on Abstraction**

---

## üü¢ **Basic-Level Questions**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is abstraction in Java?

**Answer:**
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential information.
It allows programmers to focus on *what an object does*, not *how it does it*.
In Java, abstraction is achieved through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you achieve abstraction in Java?

**Answer:**
You can achieve abstraction using:

* **Abstract classes** (`abstract` keyword)
* **Interfaces**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is an abstract class?

**Answer:**
An abstract class is a class declared with the `abstract` keyword that **cannot be instantiated**.
It can contain:

* Abstract methods (without implementation)
* Concrete methods (with implementation)
* Instance variables
* Constructors

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Can an abstract class have a constructor in Java?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
Abstract classes can have constructors.
They are used to **initialize common fields** when subclasses are created.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Can we create an object of an abstract class?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.
You **cannot instantiate** an abstract class directly.
However, you can create **references** of an abstract type pointing to subclass objects.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is an interface?

**Answer:**
An interface is a **contract** that defines abstract methods (and optionally default/static methods).
Classes implement interfaces to provide specific behavior.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Can interfaces have constructors?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.
Interfaces cannot have constructors because they **cannot be instantiated** and **don‚Äôt maintain state**.

---

## üü° **Intermediate-Level Questions**

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between abstract class and interface?

| Feature      | Abstract Class                         | Interface                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Methods      | Abstract + Concrete                    | Abstract + Default + Static       |
| Variables    | Instance + Static                      | Only `public static final`        |
| Constructors | Allowed                                | Not allowed                       |
| Inheritance  | Single                                 | Multiple                          |
| Purpose      | Shared base and partial implementation | Contract or capability definition |

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Can an abstract class implement an interface?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
An abstract class can implement an interface, but it doesn‚Äôt have to provide implementations for all interface methods.
Subclasses must implement the remaining methods.

---

### üîü Can an interface extend another interface?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
Interfaces can **extend** other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.

```java
interface A { void methodA(); }
interface B extends A { void methodB(); }
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Can a class be both abstract and final?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.

* `abstract` ‚Üí class must be extended.
* `final` ‚Üí class cannot be extended.
  They contradict each other.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Can abstract classes have static methods?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
Static methods belong to the class, not to instances.
So, abstract classes can define and use static methods.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if a subclass does not implement all abstract methods?

**Answer:**
The subclass must itself be declared **abstract**; otherwise, it causes a **compilation error**.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ What percentage of abstraction do abstract classes and interfaces provide?

**Answer:**

* **Abstract class:** Partial abstraction (0‚Äì100%)
* **Interface:** Full abstraction (100%)

---

## üî¥ **Advanced-Level Questions**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Can an interface have a main method?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
Since Java 8, interfaces can have static methods, including `main()`.

```java
interface Test {
    static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Interface main method");
    }
}
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What are default and static methods in interfaces?

**Answer:**

* **Default methods** ‚Üí Have a body, allow backward compatibility.
* **Static methods** ‚Üí Belong to the interface, not implementing classes.

Example:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void display() { System.out.println("Default method"); }
    static void show() { System.out.println("Static method"); }
}
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Why use abstraction?

**Answer:**

* Hides implementation details
* Reduces complexity
* Promotes code reusability
* Enhances scalability and maintainability

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Can we declare an abstract method as `private` or `static`?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.

* `private` methods cannot be overridden.
* `static` methods belong to the class, not instances.
  Both contradict abstraction principles.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Can abstract classes have final methods?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Yes.
A final method cannot be overridden, but an abstract class can still define it to enforce consistent behavior in subclasses.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?

| Concept           | Description                                            | Example                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**   | Hides *implementation details*                         | Using `abstract` class or `interface` |
| **Encapsulation** | Hides *data* using private variables + getters/setters | Private fields with public methods    |

They work together ‚Äî abstraction hides complexity, encapsulation hides data.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Can we make a constructor abstract in Java?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.
Constructors are not inherited or overridden, so marking them `abstract` has no meaning.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Why can‚Äôt we instantiate an abstract class?

**Answer:**
Because it may contain **abstract methods without implementation**, so Java cannot guarantee full behavior.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if an abstract class has no abstract methods?

**Answer:**
‚úÖ Valid.
Such a class cannot be instantiated but can be used as a **base class** to prevent direct object creation.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Can interfaces have instance variables?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.
All variables in an interface are implicitly:

```java
public static final
```

i.e., constants only.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Can an interface extend a class?

**Answer:**
‚ùå No.
Interfaces can only **extend other interfaces**, not classes.

---

## üí° **Bonus Conceptual Question**

### What happens behind the scenes when a class implements multiple interfaces?

Java uses the **‚Äúmultiple inheritance of type‚Äù** ‚Äî meaning:

* The class inherits **method signatures** (not implementation).
* It avoids the ‚Äúdiamond problem‚Äù because actual implementation is provided by the class itself.
