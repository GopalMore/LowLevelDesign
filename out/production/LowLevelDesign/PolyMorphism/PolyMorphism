### Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enabling objects to take on multiple forms. It allows the same operation to behave differently on different classes, enhancing code flexibility and reusability.

---

#### Real-Life Example of Polymorphism

A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who, at the same time, can have different characteristics. For instance, a man is a father, a husband, and an employee, exhibiting different behaviors in each of these roles. This is called polymorphism. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üíº

### Types of Polymorphism in Java

In Java, polymorphism can be broadly classified into two main types:

1. Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism
2. Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism

---

#### 1. Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism

Compile-time or static polymorphism occurs when the method to be executed is determined at compile time. It is achieved using method overloading or operator overloading. üõ†Ô∏è

---

##### Method Overloading

When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, they are said to be overloaded. Method overloading can be achieved by:

 Changing the number of arguments
 Changing the type of arguments üî¢üéöÔ∏è

---

Example 1: Changing the Number of Arguments


class Vehicle {
  // Method to start a vehicle with basic information
  void start(String vehicleType) {
    System.out.println("Starting a " + vehicleType);
  }

  // Overloaded method to start a vehicle with extra information
  void start(String vehicleType, int speed) {
    System.out.println("Starting a " + vehicleType + " with speed: " + speed + " km/h");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
    // Calls method with one argument
    vehicle.start("Car");

    // Calls overloaded method with two arguments
    vehicle.start("Bike", 60);
  }
}
```

---

Example 2: Changing the Type of Arguments


class Vehicle {
  // Method to start a vehicle with a string parameter
  void start(String vehicleType) {
    System.out.println("Starting a " + vehicleType);
  }

  // Overloaded method to start a vehicle with an integer parameter
  void start(int vehicleId) {
    System.out.println("Starting a vehicle with ID: " + vehicleId);
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
    // Calls method with a string argument
    vehicle.start("Truck");

    // Calls overloaded method with an integer argument
    vehicle.start(101);
  }
}
```

---

Key Features of Compile-time Polymorphism:

 Method resolution happens at compile time.
 It provides better readability and cleaner code by allowing methods with the same name to perform similar actions.

---

#### 2. Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism

Runtime polymorphism occurs when the method to be executed is determined during runtime. It is achieved through method overriding and is closely tied to inheritance.

---

##### Method Overriding

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.

---

Example:


// Parent class
class Vehicle {
  void start() {
    System.out.println("Starting a generic vehicle");
  }
}

// Subclasses overriding the start method
class Car extends Vehicle {
  @Override
  void start() {
    System.out.println("Starting a car");
  }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
  @Override
  void start() {
    System.out.println("Starting a bike");
  }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
  @Override
  void start() {
    System.out.println("Starting a truck");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vehicle myVehicle;

    // Assign a Car object to the Vehicle reference
    myVehicle = new Car();
    myVehicle.start(); // Output: Starting a car

    // Assign a Bike object to the Vehicle reference
    myVehicle = new Bike();
    myVehicle.start(); // Output: Starting a bike

    // Assign a Truck object to the Vehicle reference
    myVehicle = new Truck();
    myVehicle.start(); // Output: Starting a truck
  }
}
```

---

Key Features of Runtime Polymorphism:

 Method resolution happens at runtime based on the actual object type.
 Supports dynamic method dispatch, enabling the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to determine the appropriate method implementation.

---

### Advantages of Polymorphism

1. Code Reusability

    Encourages writing generic and reusable code by allowing a single interface to handle multiple types.

   Example:


   // Interface
   interface Vehicle {
     void start(); // Abstract method
   }

   // Implementing classes
   class Car implements Vehicle {
     @Override
     public void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting the car");
     }
   }

   class Bike implements Vehicle {
     @Override
     public void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting the bike");
     }
   }

   class Truck implements Vehicle {
     @Override
     public void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting the truck");
     }
   }

   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Bike(), new Truck()};
       for (Vehicle vehicle : vehicles) {
         vehicle.start(); // Polymorphic behavior
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   The `Vehicle` interface allows you to reuse a single loop (`for (Vehicle vehicle : vehicles)`) to handle different implementations.

2. Flexibility

    Provides flexibility in program design by enabling dynamic method behavior.

   Example:


   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       Vehicle vehicle;
       // Dynamically assigning different types of vehicles
       vehicle = new Car();
       vehicle.start(); // Output: Starting the car
       vehicle = new Bike();
       vehicle.start(); // Output: Starting the bike
       vehicle = new Truck();
       vehicle.start(); // Output: Starting the truck
     }
   }
   ```

3. Extensibility

    Allows easy extension of code by adding new classes or overriding existing methods.

   Example:


   // Adding a new type of Vehicle
   class Bus implements Vehicle {
     @Override
     public void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting the bus");
     }
   }

   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Adding new vehicle types without changing existing code
       Vehicle[] vehicles = {new Car(), new Bike(), new Truck(), new Bus()};
       for (Vehicle vehicle : vehicles) {
         vehicle.start(); // Polymorphic behavior
       }
     }
   }
   ```

---

### Disadvantages of Polymorphism

1. Complex Debugging

    Runtime polymorphism can make debugging difficult due to dynamic method resolution.

   Example:


   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.List;

   class Vehicle {
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a generic vehicle");
     }
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
     @Override
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a car");
     }
   }

   class Bike extends Vehicle {
     @Override
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a bike");
     }
   }

   class Truck extends Vehicle {
     @Override
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a truck");
     }
   }

   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       List<Vehicle> vehicleList = new ArrayList<>();
       vehicleList.add(new Car());
       vehicleList.add(new Bike());
       vehicleList.add(new Truck());
       vehicleList.add(new Vehicle());

       // Debugging challenge: What type of vehicle is being started?
       for (Vehicle vehicle : vehicleList) {
         vehicle.start(); // Runtime determines which start() method is called
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Issue: During debugging, it's unclear which specific subclass (Car, Bike, Truck, or Vehicle) is being called.

2. Performance Overhead

    Dynamic method dispatch introduces slight overhead as the JVM resolves the method during runtime.

   Example:


   class Vehicle {
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a generic vehicle");
     }
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
     @Override
     void start() {
       System.out.println("Starting a car");
     }
   }

   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       Vehicle myVehicle;
       long startTime = System.nanoTime();
       // Dynamic method dispatch
       myVehicle = new Car();
       myVehicle.start(); // JVM resolves method dynamically
       long endTime = System.nanoTime();
       System.out.println("Time taken for method dispatch: "
           + (endTime - startTime) + " nanoseconds");
     }
   }
   ```
